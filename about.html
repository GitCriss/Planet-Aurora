<p class="para3">
	Elixir was born in the metaverse but is half human, the first Hybrid being. Having the best of both worlds in her DNA gives her limitless abilities, as she is a part code, she knows it inside and out, thus knowing how to bend and break the laws of this dimension's reality.
	
	While being the first she is surely not the last. Her passionate parents proceeded to have twins a couple years after Elixir, without considering the grave consequences of having children with immense power.  
<br>
	The parents soon learned their grave mistakes the day of their last breath. One day, the twins completely lost it and struck. Rods of lighting came from the ceiling, electrecuting both their parents. Elixir the oldest stood in shock, realizing she was unsafe under the same roof as her savage siblings. Thus, her queue to run away.</p>
<br>

	<p class="para1">From then she swore to avenge her parents death and has been on that mission ever since. Of course, her sisters are now on the same mission to eliminate her. They ascend to power, becoming Queens of Planet Auroura, taking over the population and making Elixir an outlaw. Despite this law, the people have heard amazing tales, and love Elixir. She's the only one who can save the humans from the evil queens. 

 	She is a myth amongst some, others would call her a legend. She uses her senses, intuition and infinite knowledge to come to the rescue. As well as responding to a special lotus SOS that could be shone into the clouds as a call to action</p>
