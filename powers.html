<p class="para">Being limitless comes with it's responsibilities, once fallen in the wrong hands anyone could could end up infatuated with the power, ultimately becoming evil. <br> Just as her very own siblings did. She remains the last with such great power to remain on the right side. Hiding from her own family requires her to get creative with all the abilities she has at her disposal. <br> Elixir's classic move of course, is on the go. She is able to move as bits and pieces, just as the internet does, it all turns into particles of H20, a rushing stream of water, swishing from one location to the next. </p>
